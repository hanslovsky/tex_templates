\addchap{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

This is the \LaTeX{} for my master thesis. It is strongly inspired by
the work Jan Oliver Oelereich offers in his own \LaTeX{} thesis
template you can find in his
\href{https://github.com/janoliver/LaTeX-thesis-template}{git
    repository}. The reason why I create my own template is that
during the process of creating my thesis I might find other settings
more suitable for my needs. Also I like to have stuff in my own
repository so I am not in trouble in case the original author decides
to take down his repository.
Prerequesites:
\begin{itemize}
      \item \LaTeX{} (newer than 2009)
      \item biber
      \item all packages found in \emph{preamble/packages.tex}
      \item Latexmk (recommended)
\end{itemize}
